# FEWSNET API Notebooks Repository

Welcome to the FEWSNET API Notebooks Repository!

This repository is a curated collection of Jupyter notebooks
designed to serve as a practical resource for understanding
and executing public API calls. Our notebooks provide hands-on
examples, required libs and tutorials that guide you through
various data queries and manipulations using APIs.

## Features

`Comprehensive Guides:` Step-by-step notebooks on how to
interact with different public APIs, complete with detailed explanations.

`Ready-to-Use Code:` Snippets that are fully executable and can
be easily adapted for various data analysis tasks.

`Resource-Rich Documentation:` Markdown cells within notebooks
offer rich documentation and context for each step of the API interaction process.

`Community-Driven:` Opportunities for the community to contribute and
enhance the repository with new examples and improved methods.
